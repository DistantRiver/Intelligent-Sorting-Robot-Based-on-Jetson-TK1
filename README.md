# Intelligent-Sorting-Robot-Based-on-Jetson-TK1
## Brief Introduction
   This is a Student Research Training Program (SRTP) conducted by a group of five undergraduate students from Southeast University(SEU) in China. Our group aims to build an intelligent sorting robot platform with intelligent image processing capabilities.
## Project Background
   In recent years, the combination of computer vision technology and robot has become the trend of image processing and robot development. Such technology makes robots have similar recognition function of human eyes, which makes robots more autonomous and intelligent in practical applications. The sorting technology that applies robots with intelligent image processing capabilities to the production line has broad application prospects.
   By deploying the object recognition algorithm in GPU with powerful processing capability, we can achieve the goals to recognize the objects in real time and operate the manipulator to complete the sorting operation, thus creating an intelligent and automatic sorting robot which can be applied to small-scale and low-workload scenarios.
## Technology Scheme

## Our Goals
      -Capture images with the camera within its field of view
      -TK1 takes the responsibility to identify and classify the target object in the image while obtaining the position of the target object
